// Question no 22:Interational Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. Correct the error
// before finishing:

let friends: string[] = ["Neelam","Naila","Suraiya"];
console.log(friends[3]);

// International Error: Arrays are zero-indexed, so index 3 is out of bounds.

console.log(friends[2]);
