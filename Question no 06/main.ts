// Question 06: Stripping Names: Store a person's name and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and
// end of the name. Use "\t"(t) and "\n"(new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the
// name is displayed. Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

let myName: string = "\t\n Naila \t\n";
console.log(myName);
console.log(myName.trim());
