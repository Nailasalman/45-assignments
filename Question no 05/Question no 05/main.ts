 // Question no 05:Stripping Name:Store a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and
 // end of the name.Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around 
 // the name is displayed. Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

 let myName: string = "\t\n Naila \t\n";
 console.log(myName);
 console.log(myName.trim());
